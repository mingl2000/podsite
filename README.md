constitution.md/GPT-5 mini: Fill the constitution with the bare minimum requirements for a static web app based on the template.

constitution.md/GPT-5 mini: /speckit.specify  I am building a modern podcast website. I want it to look sleek, something that would stand out. Should have a landing page with one featured episode. There should be an episodes page, an about page, and a FAQ page. Should have 20 episodes, and the data is mocked - you do not need to pull anything from any real feed.

Agent/GTP-5 mini: For things that need clarification, use the best guess you
think is reasonable. Update acceptance checklist after.


spec.md/GTP-5:/speckit.plan I am going to use Next.js with static site configuration, no databases - data is embedded in the content for the mock episodes. Site is responsive and ready for mobile.

plan.md/agent: /speckit.tasks break this down into tasks

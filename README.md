constitution.md/GPT-5 mini: /speckit.specify  I am building a modern podcast website. I want it to look sleek, something that would stand out. Should have a landing page with one featured episode. There should be an episodes page, an about page, and a FAQ page. Should have 20 episodes, and the data is mocked - you do not need to pull anything from any real feed.

# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a modern, responsive static podcast site using Next.js (pages router) in static-export mode. The site will include a landing page with a featured episode, an `/episodes` listing of 20 mocked episodes (from `data/episodes.json`), per-episode static pages for the featured and one sample episode, plus `/about` and `/faq`. Styling uses Tailwind CSS for a sleek, responsive UI. The build outputs static files to `dist/` and CI runs a build + link-check prior to deploy.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js (pages router), Tailwind CSS, minimal tooling (ESLint, Prettier optional)  
**Storage**: Files — `data/episodes.json` (embedded mocked data)  
**Testing**: Link-check (e.g., `html-proofer` or `broken-link-checker`), light unit tests / snapshot tests optional (Jest + React Testing Library)  
**Target Platform**: Static web hosting / CDN (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, S3+CloudFront)  
**Project Type**: Web (static site)  
**Performance Goals**: Aim for fast first contentful paint and Lighthouse scores appropriate for static sites; keep initial payload small and optimize images.  
**Constraints**: No server runtime (static-only); no databases or external feeds; all content must be embedded and version-controlled.  
**Scale/Scope**: Small site: 20 episode entries, a few static pages, assets under `assets/` or `public/`.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

The project's static-web constitution requirements have been evaluated against the chosen design. Summary:

- **Required files**: Plan will produce `README.md` (quickstart), `assets/` (`assets/images`, `assets/audio`), `styles/` (Tailwind), and `scripts/` where needed — PASS (to be created in implementation).
- **Metadata**: `index.html`/homepage generated by Next.js pages will include `title` and `meta description` — PASS (ensure in templates).
- **Build**: `npm run build` + `npm run export` will output static artifacts to `dist/` (scripts must be added) — PASS (implementation must ensure `dist/` output path).
- **Dev server**: `npm run dev` on port `3000` is specified in quickstart — PASS.
- **Routing**: Using Next.js pages with `getStaticPaths`/`getStaticProps` produces per-page static files; SPA fallback not required for exported pages, but guidance is included — PASS.
- **HTTPS**: Deploy targets recommended (Vercel/Netlify) provide HTTPS — PASS.
- **CSP**: Guidance will be included in `README.md`; not enforced by build — OK (guidance present).
- **No secrets**: Plan uses local files and does not require secrets — PASS.
- **Accessibility & link-check**: Plan mandates `alt` attributes and CI link-check — PASS (test step required in CI).

Gate result: PASS — no constitution violations detected that block Phase 0.

```

**Structure Decision**:

Use a single Next.js project at the repository root with the following layout:

``text
package.json
next.config.js
pages/              # Next.js pages (/, /episodes, /episodes/[slug], /about, /faq)
public/             # static assets (images, favicon, sample audio)
data/               # data/episodes.json (20 mocked episodes)
styles/             # Tailwind + site CSS
scripts/            # build/test helper scripts (optional)
dist/               # export output (generated)
```

Rationale: Single project is simplest for a static Next.js site and matches the spec and constitution.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations identified that require special justification. Implementation can proceed with the single-project Next.js layout.
